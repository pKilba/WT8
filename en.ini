TEXT = "The poem The Prophet was written by Pushkin in 1826. It immediately gained wide popularity. For many writers and followers of the great poet,
 the work has become a kind of program for action, a guide in life and work. The Prophet was created in the genre of an ode, 
but its form comes into sharp contrast with the content. The odes were written with the aim of praising the greats of this world.
 The authors sought their favor in anticipation of awards and the highest favor. The 
people's poet Pushkin always spoke with contempt of human glory. He was not attracted by the wealth and respect of society. 
The Prophet is dedicated to a philosophical understanding of the place and significance of the creator in the world. Biblical theme
s only covered up the true meaning of the poem. The prophet in the poem symbolizes the poet in real life.
 A true poet should not devote his art to base needs. His destiny is to bring light and the desire for knowledge to people."
TEXT_PAGE1 = "Pushkin was still a religious person, so the poet-prophet receives his gift from God through the "six-winged seraphim." The author emphasizes that talent is the lot of the few. It is given by chance, but only to those who are tormented by spiritual thirst. The right to be called a poet can only appear through suffering and tremendous mental work."
TEXT_PAGE2 = "Pushkin was accused of praising himself in a sublime style. This is a cursory look at the work. The author notes what he went through. The past life was like wandering in the desert without purpose and meaning. The transformation of the poet was accompanied by unbearable torment, which not everyone could endure. Only after passing such a test, he was able to clearly understand the difference between good and evil, penetrate into the main secrets of the universe."
